# HomeMadeMath Website

This project is a Java Dynamic Webpage made in the Spring MVC framework. Content-wise, it's a math worksheet website. The primary functionality is being able to download math worksheets. There are also login and sign up pages. The code connects to a PostgreSQL database on my localhost that has tables for users and worksheets.
